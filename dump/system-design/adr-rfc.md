## Documenting design decisions

### RFC

Request for comments (RFC) is a type of document which describes the
design decisions, architecture, or important decisions about a system.

First of all, you need to collect all the information you want to
propose to solve the problem. After that, you need to write a document
which describes the problem, the solution, and the reasoning behind it.

And the main last step is a discussion. Team members need to review the
document and mark the inconsistencies, ask questions, and propose
another solution.

To conclude, preparing, writing, and sharing RFCs with your team
to review and iterate over the thought process that
went into the proposal is an easy way to structure the R&D process.

### ADR

Now that we've explored the steps from research over discussion up to
deciding whether to adopt a proposal or not, we're entering the domain
of Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

ADR is a document that captures the important architectural decisions
made along with its context and consequences.

In other words, ADR it's short and core version of RFC with accepted
solution.

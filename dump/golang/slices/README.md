### Runtime representation of slice and string

```go
// StringHeader is the runtime representation of a string.
// It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may
// change in a later release.
// Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data
// it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep
// a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.
//
// In new code, use unsafe.String or unsafe.StringData instead.
type StringHeader struct {
	Data uintptr
	Len  int
}

// SliceHeader is the runtime representation of a slice.
// It cannot be used safely or portably and its representation may
// change in a later release.
// Moreover, the Data field is not sufficient to guarantee the data
// it references will not be garbage collected, so programs must keep
// a separate, correctly typed pointer to the underlying data.
//
// In new code, use unsafe.Slice or unsafe.SliceData instead.
type SliceHeader struct {
	Data uintptr
	Len  int
	Cap  int
}

## Modeling your code: Communicating sequential processes

### The difference between concurrency and parallelism

Some facts, that I highlighted for myself:

- Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
- Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
- Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about execution.
- Concurrency may use parallelism, but parallelism doesn't require concurrency.

> Some extra information about things, related to concurrency and parallelism:

> - **Program** -- a set of instructions that a computer can execute.
> - **Process** -- is an instance of program.
> - **Thread** -- a unit of execution within a process.
> - **Context switching** -- the process of saving the state of a thread and restoring the state of another thread.

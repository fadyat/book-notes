# Chapter 1. Introducing Kubernetes

- Migrating from monoliths to microservices.
- Bigger number of components make it harder to configure and manage them.
- Kubernetes allows developers to deploy there apps as often as they want, without
  requiring any assistance from the ops team.
- Helps to monitoring and rescheduling apps in case of failures.
- It's becoming a standard way of running distributed apps in the cloud.

## 1.1 Understanding the need for a system like Kubernetes

### 1.1.1 Moving from monolithic apps to microservices

- If any part of a monolithic application isnâ€™t scalable, the whole application becomes unscalable, unless you can split
  up the monolith somehow.
- Simple communication between components.
- Separate component development.
- Easier to scale.
- Growing number of components makes it harder to make deployment-related decisions.
- Microservices make harder to debug and trace execution calls. (Zipkin, Jaeger, etc.)
- Opportunity to have different versions of the same libraries, tools used for
  development, etc.

### 1.1.2 Providing a consistent environment to applications

It's better to have the same team that develops the application also take part 
in deploying and taking care of it over its whole lifecycle.

This means the developer, QA and operations team now need to colaborate thorought the whole process 
- DevOps.

We want to make releases more often and give a developers the ability to make it fast and simple without
the need of the operations team.

With k8s we allows to sysadmin to focus on keeping underlying infrastructure up and running,
while not having to worry about the applications running on top of it.

> All do they own job, but they do it together and in a coordinated way.

## 1.2 Introducing container technologies 

K8S uses Linux container technologies to provide isolution of running applications.

### 1.2.1 Understanding what containers are
